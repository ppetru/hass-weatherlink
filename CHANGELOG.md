### Added

- Integration options which allows the following to be configured:
  - Polling interval
  - Unit for various measurements

  ("N", "E", "S", "W") with 16 values
- Update integration manifest to link to documentation, issue tracker,
  and specify the IoT class

### Changed

- Unit of "UV index" is now `UV index` so that Home Assistant displays it as a
  graph instead of distinct values.

- Update the README to contain installation instructions and a section about
  limitations imposed by WeatherLink
- Handle the case where WeatherLink returns multiple instances of the same data

## [0.2.6] - 2021-05-20

### Added

- "Wind max speed" sensor

### Removed

- "rain rate" attributes from "Rainfall" sensor
  
### Fixed

- "10_min_dir" from the "Wind bearing" sensor is not always sent by WeatherLink.
  If the field was absent it would cause an error.
